## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button, a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:
```{r}
#|message: FALSE
#|echo: FALSE
library(tidyverse)
x <- read.csv("mass-tracts.csv")


```

```{r}
x|>ggplot(aes(x = race, y = med_income, color = race, group = race)) +
  geom_line(size=5) +
  labs(title = "Median Income vs Race Distribution",
       x = "Race",
       y = "Median Income",
       color = "Race") +
  theme_minimal()
```
