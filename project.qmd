## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button, a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
# This is an R code chunk
message: FALSE
echo: FALSE
library(tidyverse)

# Assuming 'mass-tracts.csv' is in the same directory as the Quarto file
data <- read.csv("mass-tracts.csv")
head(data)
